The theme is very simple.

First, check `config.yml`, and change *Site settings* where you see fit. You should see something similar upon opening the file:

<h4 class="example-heading">config.yml</h4>
{% highlight yaml %}
# Site settings
title: Alpha
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
url: "http://localhost" # the base hostname & protocol for your site

exclude: ["design"]
{% endhighlight %}
